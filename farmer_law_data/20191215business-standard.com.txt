It is sad that our farmer brothers and sisters , who are protesting would welcome New Year out on roads and away from homes .

At the conclusion of the seventh round of talks held in Delhi on Wednesday , the Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar stated that the next meeting will now be held on January 4 .
`` Today 's talks were held in a very good environment and it concluded on a positive note .
Consensus on two out of four issues was reached between both sides , '' Tomar said while speaking to media after the conclusion meeting .
`` Considering the chilly weather in Delhi , I have requested the farmer leaders to send home the elderly , women , and children .
The next round of talks will be held on January 4 , '' Tomar has said .
`` The first issue was an ordinance related to the Environment .
Unions were apprehensive about farmers being included along with stubble ones .
Both sides agreed to farmers ' exclusion , '' Union Minister said further .
