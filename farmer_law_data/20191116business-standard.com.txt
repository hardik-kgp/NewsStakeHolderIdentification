The Shiromani Akali Dal ( SAD ) chief also met the families of farmers whose next of kin had been missing since January 26 , besides those whose relatives have been incarcerated for supporting the farmers ' protest , the statement said .
Badal assured the families that SAD would take up their cases and ensure appropriate legal remedies were made available to them .
He also requested his party 's Delhi unit chief Harmit Singh Kalka to establish a control room in the national capital to ensure that aggrieved families were given assistance as and when required .
The SAD leader said the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee would also contest all such cases free of cost even as he assured the families that a committee of lawyers had been established in Chandigarh and across all districts in Punjab to ensure a coordinated effort in this direction .
He requested all political parties to leave aside petty differences and unite for the greater cause of the peasantry .
He said it was now clear that farmers of Punjab , Haryana , Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh besides those from different parts of the country had formed a united front .
We must strengthen this front further to ensure that the 'kisan andolan ' is a resounding success , Badal added .
Farmers , mostly from Punjab , Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh , have been protesting at Delhi borders , demanding a rollback of the Farmers ' Produce Trade and Commerce ( Promotion and Facilitation ) Act , 2020 , the Farmers ( Empowerment and Protection ) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act , 2020 and the Essential Commodities ( Amendment ) Act , 2020 .
The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price ( MSP ) system , leaving them at the `` mercy '' of big corporations .
However , the Centre has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture .
