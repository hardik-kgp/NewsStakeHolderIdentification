A video of the incident showing protestors corning the security personnel at an elevated portion of the Red Fort has gone viral on social media .
Policemen can be seen jumping tens of feet of wall to save themselves from unruly protestors or being pushed down by them .
Authorities had also cut power to the Red Fort in order to disperse the farmers from the premises .
Thousands of protesting farmers who reached ITO from the Ghazipur border clashed with police .
Many of them driving tractors reached the Red Fort and entered the monument .
They also hoisted flags on the domes and the flagstaff at the rampart of the national monument at which national tricolour is unfurled by the Prime Minister on Independence Day .
The entire area saw chaotic scenes for hours as the protesters rampaged pelting stones and police , damaging vehicles and vandalising inside Red Fort .
Police tried to control the mob using lathicharge and firing tear gas shells .
In a statement , the police claimed it did all due diligence in following the conditions for the rally , but the protesters began their march much ahead of the scheduled time and extensive damage to public property was caused during the violence by them .
A senior police officer said a total of 86 police personnel were injured in the clashes including 41 at the Red Fort and in the East District .
He said that in the morning at Ghazipur Border , a probationer IPS officer got injured as he along with Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police ( East ) Manjeet tried to stop the farmers from breaking the barricades .
Additional DCP East Manjeet had a close shave as one of the farmers tried to hit him with his tractor but he escaped and did not sustain any injuries , the official said .
The ITO resembled a war zone with a car being vandalised by angry protesters and shells , bricks and stones littering the wide streets , a testimony to the ugly turn taken by the two-month-long farmers ' protests against the agri laws .
