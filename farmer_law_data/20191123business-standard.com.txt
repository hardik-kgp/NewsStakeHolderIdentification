On December 14 , Hazare had written to Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar , warning of a hunger strike if his demands including the implementation of the M S Swaminathan Committee 's recommendations on agriculture were not fulfilled .
Another demand made by him was grant of autonomy to the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices .
`` On the issue of farmers , I have had correspondence ( with the Centre ) five times , however , no response came .
`` As a result , I have decided to go on the last hunger strike of my life , '' said Hazare in his missive to the prime minister .
He wrote four letters to the concerned authority to seek permission to stage his hunger strike at the Ramlila Maidan in Delhi but no response came from their side too , he said .
Hazare , who was in the forefront of anti-corruption movement in 2011 , reminded that when he went on a hunger strike at the Ramlila Maidan , the then UPA government had called a special session of Parliament .
`` In that session , you and your senior ministers ( leaders of the BJP , which was then in opposition at the Centre ) had praised me , but now despite giving written assurances over the demands , you are not fulfilling them , '' he said .
He was enclosing a video of opposition MPs praising him in Parliament then , Hazare said .
