`` India witnessed Rahul Gandhi 's clarion call for violence across cities so much so that he included slums where the poor of our country lived .
Never before in our democratic history , have we witnessed apolitical leader asking for the fire of violence to spread instead of seeking peace , instead of promoting peace , Rahul Gandhi today declared war upon the Indian people and said that if his political stand is not supported by the Prime Minister of our country then cities will burn , '' the minister said .

''
Earlier in the day , Rahul Gandhi said asked protesting farmers to not end their protest .
`` We are standing with you .
Do not move back an inch .
This is your future , fight for it .
The five-ten people , who are trying to snatch your future , do not allow them .
We will help you fully .
My concern is that this situation is going to spread .
We do not need this situation to spread , we need a conversation with the farmers and we need a solution , '' he said .
