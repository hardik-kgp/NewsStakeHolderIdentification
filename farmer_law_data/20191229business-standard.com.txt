At Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border , there are multi-layer barricades to stop the movement of vehicles .
Barbed wire has also been put up to keep off people on foot .
Protesters were pouring in as Bharatiya Kisan Union members and its leader Rakesh Tikait stayed pitched at Ghazipur 's UP Gate , occupying a stretch of the Delhi-Meerut highway since November .
Hundreds of security personnel , including the Provincial Armed Constabulary ( PAC ) and Rapid Action Force ( RAF ) , kept vigil .
Drones were being used to monitor the situation and vehicles checked as more support flowed in for the BKU from Uttar Pradesh , Haryana and Rajasthan .
At Singhu on the Haryana border , a worker drilled rods in cross-formation between two rows of solid barriers .
`` The other flank was done yesterday .
Cement is to be poured in the space between the barriers on this flank to make a makeshift wall , '' he said .
The move comes days after the violent clashes between some protesters and police on January 26 during the tractor parade by the farmers .
The section of the highway at the Singhu border also saw a clash recently between farmers and a group of people who claimed to be local residents .
On Monday , the Delhi side of the Singhu border saw a sparse crowd of protesters while the Haryana side was dominated by people making vociferous speeches , denouncing the new farm laws .
Security personnel from the paramilitary forces , RAF and CRPF , were seen in relatively less numbers compared to the past few days at Singhu .
But a large number of police personnel manned the stretch .
Besides the makeshift wall on the highway , a small trench was dug up earlier across a street a little off the highway and cement barricades put up on both the sides .
Farmer leaders at the site , however , asserted that the barricades wo n't cage their spirit .
Balwinder Singh Sirsa , a farmer leader from Sirsa in Haryana , urged protesters not get demotivated by what happened on January 26 , claiming it was `` orchestrated by some people to denigrate the protest .
A woman protester from Haryana , addressing a large gathering from the dais , said the alleged conspiracy on that day failed to weaken the movement and has rather injected `` a new lease of life '' in it .
Randhir Singh , 85 , a farmer from Haryana , said , `` We are not terrorists or Khalistanis .
We are fighting for our rights .
Attempts are still being made to defame and weaken us .
