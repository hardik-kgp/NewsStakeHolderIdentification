`` Those who are saying the ordinances will help the farmers are lying .
On the contrary , we will become the pawns of corporates .
We appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to listen to us .
And request all farmers throughout the country to come out and stand against these ordinances , '' Pandher had said earlier .
This comes after three ordinances were promulgated to usher in agricultural reforms for raising the income of the farmers and giving them more freedom to sell their produce .
Besides Punjab , farmer protests have been witnessed in Telangana and Haryana .
Notably , the move has also brought differences between allies Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) and the Shiromani Akali Dal ( SAD ) , which has also opposed the ordinances .
Displaying her opposition to the Bills tabled by the NDA government , SAD leader and Union Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal had on Thursday evening resigned from the Union Cabinet .
Sources in the government said that as politics in Punjab is agriculture dominated and revolves around the agri-economy , SAD was under pressure to take an anti-government stand on the bill .
Punjab will go to the polls in about one-and-half-years .
Meanwhile , the Lower House of the Parliament , Lok Sabha , on Thursday passed two bills related to `` reforms '' in agriculture marketing after a debate with Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar stating that the legislation will `` end licence raj '' and farmers will be free to sell their agricultural produce as per their own choice .
BJP ally SAD , along with several opposition parties including the Congress , strongly opposed the two Bills .
The President had on June 5 this year promulgated Farmers ' Produce Trade and Commerce ( Promotion & Facilitation ) Ordinance 2020 , Farmers ( Empowerment and Protection ) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance 2020 and the Essential Commodities ( Amendment ) Ordinance Act , 2020 .
