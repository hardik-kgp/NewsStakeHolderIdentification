Topics MSP | farmers | Rajnath Singh Press Trust of India | New Delhi Last Updated at October 1 , 2020 19:08 IST https : //mybs.in/2YQwxCJ Seeking to allay concerns of farmers over a new set of legislations amid continuing protests by some parties , senior union minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday assured the farm community that the MSP ( minimum support price ) will not only stay , but it will also be continuously increased too in coming years .
He also assured that no one can claim ownership of farmers ' land in lieu of contract farming and said there are enough measures in the legislations to safeguard the interests of farmers .
Opposition parties have alleged that farmers would be left at the mercy of corporates under the new laws , which have come into effect after the passage of three key bills in the recent monsoon session of Parliament .
Hitting out at Congress and other opposition parties , Singh said they are trying to create misunderstandings about the farm bills passed by Parliament .
He also attacked Congress for the burning of a tractor by protesters from their youth wing .
`` A tractor was burnt .
What is its logic ?
As weapons are sacred and respectable for soldiers , similarly tractors are to farmers .
And I know this being a farmer , in any eventuality farmer will never burn his tractor .
This was done by a political party for its political interest , '' he said .
The Congress ' youth wing activists on Monday had set a tractor ablaze near India Gate in the national capital , a few hundred metres from the Rashtrapati Bhavan and Parliament , to protest the contentious farm laws .
Talking to a select group of journalists , the Defence Minister said , `` Being a farmer 's son myself , I want to make it clear that the Modi government will never do anything that is not in the interest of farmers .
And these agriculture-related bills are for economic and social empowerment of farmers . ''
Singh also accused the Opposition of creating a misunderstanding among people about the minimum support price ( MSP ) mechanism and the mandi system and categorically said that both will stay .
`` I want to assure farmers that the MSP will stay and rather it will be continuously increased in the coming years , in any case , it will not be abolished , '' he said adding that MSP in oilseeds and pulses increased by 23 times during the BJP-led NDA government .
On amendment in the APMC Act , Rajnath said the government is not ending the mandi system and rather it is giving more options to farmers to sell their produce including at more mandis .
He also said that at times farmers were charged taxes and did not get the right MSP in mandis , but the new law will provide them more options to sell their produce .
Talking about contract farming , Singh said enough provisions have been made in the new law to safeguard the interests of farmers .
Farmers will get the price of their produce as decided by them in the contract , and sufficient provisions have been incorporated to ensure that the price does not go below the contracted rate , he said .
Singh further said if prices of their produce rise at a later stage , farmers will also get proportionately higher payments .
Accusing the Opposition of creating misapprehensions about the new law that it poses a threat to farmers ' land , Singh said , `` No power , in any case , can claim ownership of farmers ' land using this bill .
Enough measures have been made to safeguard the interests of farmers .

We are ready to listen to their suggestions for the welfare of farmers .
I have already started talking to farmers organisations to clear misgivings and misconceptions , '' he said .
The government has been under attack from the Opposition for the passage of three farms bill in the recently held monsoon session of Parliament .
The government presented these bills as pro-farmers , saying these will ensure that farmers get better prices for their produce and do not get subjected to regulations of 'mandis ' .
It has also said that farmers will be now free to sell their produce to anyone and these legislations will increase competition and promote private investment , which will help in the development of farm infrastructure and generate employment .
However , opposition parties have slammed the bills as `` anti-farmers '' , claiming that the agriculture sector will be left to the fate of corporate interests .
President Ram Nath Kovind has already given assent to the three farm bills -- The Farmers '' Produce Trade and Commerce ( Promotion and Facilitation ) Bill , 2020 , The Farmers ( Empowerment and Protection ) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill , 2020 and The Essential Commodities ( Amendment ) Bill , 2020 .
