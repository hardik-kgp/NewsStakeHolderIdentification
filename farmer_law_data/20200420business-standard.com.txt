Topics Uttar Pradesh | panchayats | Elections IANS | Agra Last Updated at April 15 , 2021 09:53 IST https : //mybs.in/2ZdbIul The Bharatiya Kisan Union ( BKU ) has issued a statement asking people to choose any candidate , other than those from the BJP in the Panchayat elections that begin on Thursday .
A statement issued by the BKU general secretary read , `` Samyukt Kisan Morcha ( united farmers front ) is fighting against the anti-farmer policies of the Central government .
We are going to the states where Assembly polls are being held and asking people not to vote for the BJP .
Regarding the Panchayat elections in UP , we would like to state that BKU is a non-political organisation .
We do not indulge in politics and do not appeal to people to vote for any party .
We want people to vote for anyone except BJP-supported candidates .

It is a local election and people are free to choose anyone they want . ''
Gurnam Singh Chaduni , a senior leader of Samyukt Kisan Morcha , said , `` So far , no agenda for discussion over the Panchayat election in UP has been received by the Morcha .
Our stand is clear .
BJP will be opposed in elections . ''
He said , `` Farmer leaders from UP have been actively campaigning against the BJP in West Bengal .
They should do that in UP as well . ''
This comes a day after BKU general secretary Yudhveer Singh had told reporters that the farmers ' outfit has not taken any stand against the ruling party in the upcoming Panchayat polls in UP .
Meanwhile , several farmer leaders have themselves joined the poll fray .
Somveer Yadav , Pradeep Sharma and Mukesh Pathak are contesting for the post of block development council members .
Former army man Ramnath Singh Sikarwar , who was the 'Republic Day parade commander ' of the farmers during the tractor rally ' at the Chilla border , is contesting for the post of district council member .
Savitri Chahar , Agra district head of the BKU women 's wing , who had joined the protest at Ghazipur border with 18 other women supporters , is also a candidate .
With this , farmers ' issues have , perhaps , for the first time , upstaged caste dynamics in Uttar Pradesh .
The farmer has become the central figure in this Panchayat election and farmer leaders have become star campaigners .
