Topics Mike Pompeo | Amit Shah | Farm Bills Press Trust of India | Washington Last Updated at December 25 , 2020 08:13 IST https : //mybs.in/2YSgf7r A group of seven influential US lawmakers , including Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal , have written to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , urging him to raise the issue of farmers ' protest in India with his Indian counterpart .
India has called the remarks by foreign leaders and politicians on protests by farmers as `` ill-informed '' and `` unwarranted '' , asserting that the matter pertains to the internal affairs of a democratic country.document.write ( `` < ! -- '' ) ; if ( isUserBanner== '' free '' & & ( displayConBanner==1 ) ) document.write ( `` -- > '' ) ; googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.defineOutOfPageSlot ( '/6516239/outofpage_1x1_desktop ' , 'div-gpt-ad-1490771277198-0 ' ) .addService ( googletag.pubads ( ) ) ; googletag.pubads ( ) .enableSyncRendering ( ) ; googletag.enableServices ( ) ; } ) ; '' We have seen some ill-informed commentsrelating to farmers in India .
Such comments are unwarranted , especially when pertaining to the internal affairs of a democratic country , '' External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said earlier this month .
This is an issue of particular concern to Sikh Americans linked to Punjab , although it also heavily impacts the Indian Americans belonging to other Indian states , the lawmakers said in their letter to Pompeo dated December 23 .
Many Indian Americans are directly affected as they have family members and ancestral land in Punjab and are concerned for the well-being of their families in India .
In view of this serious situation , we urge you to contact your Indian counterpart to reinforce the United States ' commitment to the freedom of political speech abroad , they said .
In their letter , the lawmakers said that the US as a nation that is familiar with political protests can offer counsel to India during their current period of social disturbance .
As national legislators , we respect the right of the government of India to determine national policy , in compliance with existing law .
We also acknowledge the rights of those in India and abroad who are currently protesting peacefully against agricultural laws that many Indian farmers see as an attack on their economic security , the lawmakers said .
Thousands of farmers from Punjab , Haryana and several other states have been protesting on various borders of Delhi since November 26 , seeking repeal of three farm laws enacted in September .
Dubbing these laws as `` anti-farmer '' , these farmers claim that the newly enacted legislations would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system , leaving them at the `` mercy '' of big corporations .
However , the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture .
There have been multiple rounds of talks between representatives of the protestors and the Indian government but the logjam continues .
In addition to Jayapal , the letter has been signed by Congressmen Donald Norcross , Brendan F Boyle , Brian Fitzpatrick , Mary Gay Scanlon , Debbie Dingell and David Trone .
Over the past few weeks , more than a dozen US Congressmen have expressed their concerns on the ongoing protest by the farmers in India .
Earlier this month , Congressman John Garamendi , Co-Chair of the American Sikh Caucus , along with Congressman Jim Costa and Congresswoman Shelia Jackson Lee members of the American Sikh Caucus sent a letter to Indian Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu , expressing solidarity with the protestors and defending their right to peaceful protest .
Democratic American lawmaker David Trone on Tuesday urged the Indian government to provide safety to the protesting farmers and hailed the recent offers of dialogue and a proposal from India 's Supreme Court to set up mediation .
