ANI | Updated : Sep 28 , 2020 17:32 IST New Delhi [ India ] , September 28 ( ANI ) : Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Monday wrote a letter to West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar , urging him to intervene and ensure that `` Three Black Laws '' withdrawn and repealed forthwith.By `` Three Black Laws '' Chowdhury indicated at the recent agriculture laws -- The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce ( Promotion and Facilitation ) Bill , 2020 , The Farmers ( Empowerment and Protection ) Agreement on Price Assurance Farm Services Bill , 2020 and The Essential Commodities ( Amendment ) Bill , 2020.Chowdhury alleged that the Union Government led by the Bharatiya Janat party ( BJP ) is `` conspiring to defeat the 'Green Revolution ' by bringing in the captioned anti-farmer Bills .
`` `` This is a well-designed conspiracy to destroy the 'anndata ' farmer and the agriculture at the altar of a handful of crony capitalists .
Drunk with power and determined to serve the crony capitalists friends , Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi continues to be blind to the agony of the farmers and suppress every voice of protest .
Modi Government is dictatorially subverting the voice of farmers ' representatives inside the Parliament and has unleashed a draconian 'Lathi-Danda Regime ' on the protesting farming community , '' Chowdhury said in his letter to Dhankhar .
`` Modi Government has subverted India 's federal structure , subjugated the constitutional mandate , suppressed the established parliamentary procedure by using its draconian majority to pass 'the three black laws ' without any discussion or prior consultation .
The laws were illegally and unconstitutionally passed in Rajya Sabha , without even permitting a division of votes and by using force by deploying marshals and by evacuating the members of Parliament , '' he alleged .
Chowdhury said agriculture experts believe that `` under the garb of the Bills , the Modi government actually intends to implement the 'Shanta Kumar Committee Report ' so that the Government is not compelled to make procurement at Minimum Support Price ( MSP ) through FCI ( Food Corporation of India ) and thereby save an amount of around Rs 1 lakh crores annually and this will directly cause adverse effect on the agriculture and farming .
`` `` In these Bills , there is neither any provision for the protection of labourers rights nor for the protection of the rights of the persons , who are engaged in agriculture taking land on rent or on produce sharing basis .
It seems that they have been left to fend for themselves , '' he said.Chowdhury further alleged that the three Bills ( now laws ) are the `` direct attack on the federal structure of the country .
'Agriculture and Mandis ' come under the purview of the state governments under the 7th Schedule of the Constitution , but , the Modi government did n't consider it worthwhile to take the state governments in confidence on this issue .
Protection and incentivising agriculture has been naturally the subject under the domain of the states , but , they were not consulted at all .
On the contrary , market fees and rural development funds levied for the development of villages and agriculture was done away unilaterally , which is a flagrant transgression of constitutional provisions .
`` `` The Anndata farmer and labourers will never forget the conspiracy of the Modi government to convert 'the disaster confronting the farmers ' into an 'opportunity for the capitalists ' under the garb of the pandemic , '' he added.Urging Dhankhar , Chowdhury added , `` We urge upon your good self to intervene and ensure that these Bills are withdrawn and repealed forthwith .
