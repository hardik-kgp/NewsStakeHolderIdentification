Thousands of farmers , mainly from Punjab and Haryana , are still camping at several borders areas in Delhi-NCR .
They have been protesting against the three farm laws for over month now .

`` Continuation of agitation , with incidents of damage to industrial & other infrastructure , would turn investors away from Punjab , '' the letter states .
This was the sixth round of talks held between the protesting farmer unions and the Centre to break over one-month-long deadlock on the farm laws brought by the government .
The sixth round of talks was originally scheduled for December 9 but it was called off after an informal meeting of Home Minister Amit Shah with some union leaders failed to reach any breakthrough .
The fifth round of talks was held on December 5 .
The protesting farmer unions are sticking to their hardline position that the discussions will only be on the modalities of repealing the three new agri laws and giving a legal guarantee on the MSP among other issues .
On the contrary , the government has presented these laws as major agriculture reforms aimed at helping farmers and increasing their income , but the protesting unions fear that the new legislations have left them at the mercy of big corporates by `` weakening '' the MSP and mandi systems .
